This playbook will install Zabbix server and agents, configure the MySQL database for Zabbix, and set up the Zabbix frontend with Apache and PHP. Remember to replace the placeholders like <zabbix_server_ip_address>, <ssh_username>, and <ssh_password> with the appropriate values for your server and hosts.

Always remember to test the playbook in a controlled environment before using it in production.
